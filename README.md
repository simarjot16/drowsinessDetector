Human body is a huge treasure box with a lot of untold mystries left to be unfolded. This can be seen as many things can be predicted and told about a person by different patterrns in his body. For a great example, our blink pattern changes with several biological factors, for example while we are sleepy, or while we are emotionally hyper.
This code helps us predict if a person is drowsy on not by seeing there blink pattern and yawning pattern. This can be of great use to reduce the number of road accidents due to drowsy driver. 

# What is Eye Aspect Ratio?
The Eye Aspect Ratio is a constant value when the eye is open, but rapidly falls to 0 when the eye is closed.
A program can determine if a personâ€™s eyes are closed if the Eye Aspect Ratio falls below a certain threshold.The program uses a facial training set to understand where certain points exist on facial structures. The program then plots the same points on region of interests in other images, if they exists. The program uses priors to estimate the probable distance between keypoints.
